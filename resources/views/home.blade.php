            <div class="faq-answer" id="faq-answer-1" aria-hidden="true">
              The only way to buy a work from Pieter Adriaans is to visit his studio on the isolated island of São
              Jorge in the Azores or via this website. No other channels or galleries can offer his work for sale.
              This is not an online shop, but a way to contact Pieter or one of his assistants. Pieter’s works are
              unique objects intricately related to his personal life, and only a very limited selection is for sale.
              Pieter regards selling a painting, a drawing, or another work of art as a transaction between
              individuals. If you like a work, get in touch with us via email. We will contact you to confirm your
              order and all shipping details
